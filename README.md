## Acadmeic Projects:
1. **Title: RAG-Driven PDF Query Tool**  | [Link](https://github.com/prabudhd2003/rag_for_pdf)                                                                                                       
- Developed the tool from scratch, implementing document preprocessing to split the PDF into smaller chunks, generating embeddings to represent these chunks and user queries for efficient matching using a sentence-transformer model. 
- Leveraged a BERT-based model to generate answers based on relevant passages retrieved from the text, ensuring accurate and context-aware responses.
- **Tech Stack:** PyTorch, sentence-transformers, BERT

2. **Title: SafeWeb Extension**  | [Link](https://github.com/prabudhd2003/SafeWebExtension_WebPage)   	                                                                       
- Designed SafeWeb, a browser extension, to enhance online safety by images on websites in real-time, dynamically blurring inappropriate content, and providing warnings for unsafe content.
- Fine-tuned ResNet-18 model using transfer learning for image classification using 50,000+ images scraped from the internet, and used ONNX.js for efficient in-browser processing.
- Designed an user-friendly interface for immediate content safety feedback. SafeWeb can also be adapted for content suitability in professional environments.
- **Tech Stack:** PyTorch, ONNX, CNN, ResNet-18, JavaScript

3. **Title: Algorithmic Game Development and Solvers**
- **Snake Game (Q-Learning Algorithm)** | [Link](https://github.com/prabudhd2003/snake)
    - Created a Snake game using Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique, to train the snake on how to maximize its score by eating food while avoiding obstacles and itself.

- **Chrome Dinosaur Game (Genetic Algorithm)** | [Link](https://github.com/prabudhd2003/dino_game)
    - Developed a Chrome Dinosaur game that implements a genetic algorithm to evolve the agentâ€™s ability to avoid obstacles. The algorithm adjusts parameters based on fitness scores to improve the playerâ€™s survival.

- **Sudoku Solver (Backtracking Algorithm)** | [Link](https://github.com/prabudhd2003/SudokuSolver)
    - Designed a Java-based Sudoku solver with a GUI. It demonstrates the Backtracking and MRV (Minimum Remaining Value) algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles in real-time.

- **Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer** | [Link](https://github.com/prabudhd2003/PathAlgorithms)
    - Built a path finding tool in JAVA to demonstrate shortest-path algorithms including Dijkstra's and A*.

4. **Title: Arcade Games Development**
- **Tetris**  | [Link](https://github.com/prabudhd2003/Tetris_cpp)
    - Developed a fully-functional Tetris game using C++ and raylib demonstrating strong OOP principles, including modular code design, encapsulation, and inheritance for handling shapes, rotation, and scoring.

- **Ping Pong** | [Link](https://github.com/prabudhd2003/ping_pong_game)
    - Created a two-player Ping Pong game using C++ and raylib, showcasing skills in game physics, collision detection, and OOP concepts such as classes for paddles, balls, and game rules.
